# precision-rehab

## About
I created this repository to share code for analyzing EHR data for precision rehabilitation projects. I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at Johns Hopkins University working in rehabilitation medicine and using the Precision Medicine Analytics Platform. While the platform and all the data live within Johns Hopkins, I want to make generic versions of some of my code that can be used by other rehab researchers that use EHR data.

Currently, this repository holds R code that will only make sense to run in PMAP, but my vision is interoperability.
